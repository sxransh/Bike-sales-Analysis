# Bike-sales-Analysis

My project involves a comprehensive data analysis of bike sales using Microsoft Excel for data analysis, visualization, dashboard creation, and pivot table-based insights.
. The objective is to understand customer demographics, commuting patterns, and purchasing behavior to derive insights and optimize sales strategies.


I added an extra worksheet to ensure the original/raw data remains intact in case of any errors. The dataset had a column titled "Marital Status" with values "M" and "S", which could cause confusion. Therefore, I transformed the data by replacing these values with "Married" and "Single" for better clarity.

The excel sheet is included.

- A visually appealing and user-friendly dashboard to filter and analyze data.
- Detailed visualizations, including bar graphs and line charts, to represent income distribution, customer age groups, and commuting distances.
